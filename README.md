# Rainfall Prediction Model With Machine Learning
This project focuses on the development of machine learning models for rainfall prediction in major cities across Australia.


Project Objective: Develop machine learning models for rainfall prediction in major cities to enhance timely forecasting and reduce human and financial losses from extreme weather events.

Data and Methods: Utilize diverse weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and historical precipitation records, to train and evaluate machine learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods.

Evaluation Metrics: Rigorous statistical analysis and performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) assess model effectiveness in predicting rain occurrence, enabling tailored approaches for different cities.

Implications: Improved rainfall prediction benefits agriculture, water resource management, disaster preparedness, and urban planning, aiding farmers, water authorities, and emergency management agencies in optimizing resources and responding to extreme weather events proactively.

Objective: Develop accurate machine learning models for rainfall prediction, addressing class imbalance, missing data, outliers, and feature selection in major cities.

Aim: Enhance forecasting by preprocessing data and comparing models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Random Forest, and LightGBM.

Motivation: Timely and precise rainfall forecasts reduce losses in extreme weather events, benefitting agriculture, water management, and emergency planning in Australia.

Techniques
Class Imbalance: Addressed with minority class oversampling.
Missing Data: Imputed using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE).
Outlier Detection: Identified outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
Feature Selection: Used filter and wrapper methods for selecting relevant features.
Machine Learning Models: Employed models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Random Forest.
Evaluation: Assessed performance with metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and Cohenâ€™s Kappa.
