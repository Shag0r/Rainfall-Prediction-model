Project Objective: Develop machine learning models for rainfall prediction in major cities to enhance timely forecasting and reduce human and financial losses from extreme weather events.

Data and Methods: Utilize diverse weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and historical precipitation records, to train and evaluate machine learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods.

Evaluation Metrics: Rigorous statistical analysis and performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) assess model effectiveness in predicting rain occurrence, enabling tailored approaches for different cities.

Implications: Improved rainfall prediction benefits agriculture, water resource management, disaster preparedness, and urban planning, aiding farmers, water authorities, and emergency management agencies in optimizing resources and responding to extreme weather events proactively.

Objective: Develop accurate machine learning models for rainfall prediction, addressing class imbalance, missing data, outliers, and feature selection in major cities.

Aim: Enhance forecasting by preprocessing data and comparing models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Random Forest, and LightGBM.

Motivation: Timely and precise rainfall forecasts reduce losses in extreme weather events, benefitting agriculture, water management, and emergency planning in Australia.

Techniques

Class Imbalance: Addressed with minority class oversampling.
